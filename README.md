The project focuses on the implementation and analysis of the AES and RSA algorithms on both CPU and GPU, and executing Shor's algorithm on a quantum backend. The aim is to explore the efficiency and feasibility of quantum computing in solving cryptographic problems.

In this project, we explore the parallelization of critical sequential algorithms, focusing on AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman), and Shor's algorithm, to analyze their performance across different computing architectures—CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs. These algorithms are fundamental in the fields of cryptography and quantum computing. By parallelizing these algorithms, we aim to enhance computational efficiency and evaluate key performance metrics such as execution time  on various hardware platforms. This project is significant because it seeks to improve the speed and security of cryptographic algorithms like AES and RSA and to demonstrate the potential of quantum processing units (QPUs) through Shor’s algorithm. Through a comparative analysis, we intend to identify the most efficient platforms for specific computational tasks. Our methodology includes implementing both the original sequential and parallelized versions of these algorithms, executing them on CPUs, GPUs, and QPUs, and measuring their performance. The expected outcomes include detailed performance profiles, insights into the challenges and benefits of parallelization, and recommendations for optimal computational platforms for different types of algorithms.
